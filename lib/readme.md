# Sample viewer and test tool for Highcharts

* Use the icon next to the sample to either compare against a previous version, or to run a unit test. Unit tests
are marked with a jigsaw puzzle icon.
* By default, visual tests compare against the latest stable release.
* See the <a href="https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts/tree/master/utils#tests" target="_blank">Github readme file</a> for guidelines on setting up the tests.

For testing mobile and legacy browsers, check out <a href="/samples/mobile" target="_blank">the simplified mobile samples</a>. For testing this on a real device on your network, use the IP address of your local server.
You'll find the IP address in the terminal when you start the _utils_ server (like `http://192.168.xxx.xxx/samples/mobile`).
